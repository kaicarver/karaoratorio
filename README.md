Karaoke, for oratorios :)

I would just like some visual aid to knowing what it is that people are singing when I am listening to choir music.

(I guess it should be called "karaora", since karaoke カラオケ is a bimoraic clipped compound of Japanese kara 空 "empty" and ōkesutora オーケストラ "orchestra", and oratorio in Japanese is ... oratorio オラトリオ).
