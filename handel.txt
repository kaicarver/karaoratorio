[15] Chorus
the earth swallowed them.

[16] Duet (Alto, Tenor)
Thou in thy mercy hast led forth thy people which thou hast redeemed; thou hast
guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

[17] Chorus
The people shall hear, and be afraid; sorrow shall take hold on them: all the
inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away: by the greatness of thy arm they shall be
as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord, which thou hast purchased.

[18] Air (Alto)
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in
the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O

he thrown into the sea. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. I will sing unto the
Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into
the sea.
